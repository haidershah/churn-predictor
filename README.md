# Predict Churn Rates for a Spotify/Pandora type service

## Installation
You need Anaconda's distribution of Python to run this. The version of Python I've used is 3.

## Project Motivation
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. I built the model using Spark, as it has the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets.

## File Descriptions
- Sparkify.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook which has all the code and analysis.
- mini_sparkify_event_data.json - Data on which the analysis is run
